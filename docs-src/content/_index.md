**DIVINER** is a free and open-source Wordpress plugin for small to mid-size institutions with public archiving needs. 

**DIVINER** 1.0 is a digital platform built for archiving, organizing, and presenting large amounts of photographs, audio, video, and documents - or all four! It’s main selling point is an audience-friendly public interface that encourages personal interaction and engagement. **DIVINER** might be right for _your _organization if you have a collection of humanities materials you would like to share with the public (for example, a collection of 3,000 photographs of a large farm in the early 1900s; or thousands of audio clips and interviews related to immigration in Wisconsin).

## About the Creators

**DIVINER** was created by a team at North Country Public Radio (an affiliate station of National Public radio - NPR), including Project Manager Amy Feiereisel, Digital Developer Graeme Hoffman, Station Manager Ellen Rocco, Digital Editor Dale Hobson, and Digital Director Bill Haenel. 

After conceiving a people-powered photo history project (North Country at Work, ncpr.org/work) that _needed_ a platform like **DIVINER**, and searching fruitlessly for an affordable already-existing software, we decided to build one in late 2016. About a year later we had a website up and running with a place for stories, photo collections, and most importantly, a reactive archive filled with about 2,000 photos. 

The team applied for an NEH Digital Advancement for the Humanities grant to white-label the platform and make it available to other non-profit organizations (like museums, historical associations, and public media organizations). Our first version of the platform, DIVINER 1.0, became available on May 1, 2019.

## Future of the project

This is **DIVINER** 1.0. 

We plan to have future releases, and are currently working with organizations, big AND small, from around the United States to populate their own installations of **DIVINER**.

## What DIVINER does

First, a little on what **DIVINER** is not: it is NOT an internal cataloguing database. It is a space to organize and share media in a public-friendly archive! Though it is a FABULOUS way to sort through large amounts of material, and may be used as a way to search through a full collection, we do not suggest an organization store MASTER images, documents, or videos in **DIVINER**. They will a) take up too much space, and b) you should always have a back-up (or several) of your master digital files. 

The heart of **DIVINER** is our browse experience for your materials (referred to as “archive items”). We also offer a unique collections experience, and let users custom design other desired pages (examples: Homepage, About, Contact Us, History, etcetera). A user can also create standard WordPress posts and stories.

title: "Is DIVINER right for you?"
draft: false
---


Ask yourself these questions - if you answer yes to 3 or more of them, DIVINER might be what youâ€™re looking for!

\
\

### Materials

- Do you have a project with more the 100 individual pieces of media (photo, video, audio)? 

- Do you want to share these pieces as an archive with the public? 

- Can you think of ways to search through your data? 

\
\

### Tech Needs

- Can you (or someone in your organization or company) devote considerable time to customizing an archive and uploading your media? 

- Does that person have experience with WordPress. If not, are they willing to learn? Though we outline in detail the steps required to install and configure **DIVINER**, it is not a turn-key solution, and _because_ it is customizable, requires very thoughtful set-up. 

\
\

### Potential Use Cases

**Museums, historical associations, or libraries** who have digitized either their whole collection, or subsets of their collection, and wish to make those digital files (photos, photos of objects, documents, videos) available to the public. **DIVINER** may be considered a simpler Wordpress friendly alternative to Omeka.

**Humanities Organizations** who wish to share special projects for which they have amassed a large amount of materials 

**Public Media Stations** who wish to aggregate reporting on a certain theme or topic 

Here are a couple of example **DIVINER** projects:

*   Photo project collecting images of work from around a region of New York State
*   Historical photo archive of a 20th century farm 
*   Media archive for a years-long project documenting the movement of Columbian immigrants, including photos, video, and personal written testimony
*   Repository for federal court cases concerning the topic of imprisoning minors
*   Audio archive of short nature sounds, to be used by a nature center when they are creating new displays

### Technology Ecosystem

Currently **Diviner** is comprised of two active projects, a Wordpress plugin and a Wordpress theme. 

**Wordpress Diviner Archive Plugin**

[https://wordpress.org/plugins/diviner-archive/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/diviner-archive/)

The plugin includes all the functionality necessary for building out an archive with multifacet search. The plugin created a archive item custom post type and adds an administrative tool to the Wordpress backend for managing your fields. It also allows you to drop in a shortcde (`[diviner_browse_page]`) for outputting the real time browse experience. This plugin may be used with any theme.

\
\

**Wordpress Diviner Archive Theme**

[https://wordpress.org/themes/diviner-archive/](https://wordpress.org/themes/diviner-archive/)

The responsive theme has several widget areas, two templates, and customizations options for fonts and colors. It works well with the diviner archive plugin or on its own. 

\
\
Prior to the release of these two active projects available on wordpress.org, a standalone theme was developed to include all the functionality of the above plugin. With features like pre-poluating of browse and home pages, custom blocks, and a widget for displaying select archive items, this theme was a turnkey solution for anyone looking to start an archive project. This standalone theme only exists as tagged releases from github and may not be updated much in the future.

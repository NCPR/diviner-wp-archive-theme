Ask yourself these questions - if you answer yes to 3 or more of them, DIVINER might be what youâ€™re looking for! 

## Materials

- Do you have a project with more the 100 individual pieces of media (photo, video, audio)? 
- Do you want to share these pieces as an archive with the public? 
- Can you think of ways to search through your data? 

## Tech Needs

- Can you (or someone in your organization or company) devote considerable time to customizing an archive and uploading your media? 
- Does that person have experience with WordPress / if not, are they willing to learn? Though we outline in detail the steps required to install and configure DIVINER, it is not a turn-key solution, and because it is customizable, requires very thoughtful set-up. 

## Potential Use Cases: 

- **Museums, historical associations, or libraries** who have digitized either their whole collection, or subsets of their collection, and wish to make those digital files (photos, photos of objects, documents, videos) available to the public 
  
- **Humanities Organizations** who wish to share special projects for which they have amassed a large amount of materials 
  
- **Public Media Stations** who wish to aggregate reporting on a certain theme or topic 

Here are a couple of example DIVINER projects:
  
- Photo project collecting images of work from around a region of New York State
- Historical photo archive of a 20th century farm 
- Media archive for a years-long project documenting the movement of Columbian immigrants, including photos, video, and personal written testimony
- Repository for federal court cases concerning the topic of imprisoning minors
- Audio archive of short nature sounds, to be used by a nature center when they are creating new displays

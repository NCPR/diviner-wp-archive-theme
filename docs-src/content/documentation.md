## Requirements

- a web server compatible with WordPress – we suggest WP Engine, Digital Ocean, and Site Ground 
- optional installs: elastic search (DIVINER will work without Elastic Search, but without it, there is a limit to how many records you can have within your system) 
- additional optional plug-ins
- back-up system for your server
 
If you’re looking for a further level of customization or do not wish to set up DIVINER yourself, consider hiring a digital developer.

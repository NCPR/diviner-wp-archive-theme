      <description>The following instructions provide a how-to in setting up your new archiving site with the DIVINER plugin and (optional) theme. Before proceeding, please make sure DIVINER is a good fit for your project (See: IS DIVINER RIGHT FOR YOU?) and that you&amp;rsquo;ve already installed the plug-in or theme (SEE: GETTING STARTED). What you&amp;rsquo;ll find below is a step-by-step guide to getting set up.

      <description>Define Your Project We recommend potential users define their project as much as they can before they get started. It will help immeasurably in the overall installation and configuration of DIVINER.
 NAME. What will you call your DIVINER archive? Decide on a title. CONTENT. What is going IN your DIVINER archive? Decide now what you want to put into the archive, because you will design your search mechanisms by which you want to sort through your materials before you upload your materials, not after.</description>

      <description>Ask yourself these questions - if you answer yes to 3 or more of them, DIVINER might be what youâ€™re looking for!

Materials  Do you have a project with more the 100 individual pieces of media (photo, video, audio)?
 Do you want to share these pieces as an archive with the public?
 Can you think of ways to search through your data?</description>

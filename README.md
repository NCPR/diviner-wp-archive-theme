## Technology overview

This project is based on the excellent [Tonik Starter Theme](/README_Tonik.md) because of all the excellent workflow and build mechanism that Tonik created in order to help developers organize their code.

* NPM and webpack for build system
* Composer for dependencies
* SASS for styling
* ECMA 6 for JS development
* Standard wordpress templating and customizer for theme variations.

## Development

There are two parts to this development stack. 

1. General theme with JS, CSS and templates
2. The ReactJS based browse application which appears in the browse template. Located in /browse-app

Each has it's own yarn/npm webpack build system. Eventually, the build systems may be combined with separate entry points and resource chunking.

### General Theme

Run `nvm use` at top level. Run `yarn install` to set up dependencies. `yarn run dev` for development and `yarn run prod` for production. 

JS and SASS files are located in /resources/assets.

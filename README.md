# Diviner Archiving Theme

A wordpress theme that allows small institutions and media organizations to create a public-facing, custom archive interface for a themed collection of media.

The main goals of this project are

* Customizable multi-faceted search mechanism 
* Based on open source technologies
* Dublin Core like meta data fields 
* Easy to use by smaller organizations
* Customizable theme templates and experience
* Follow wordpress standards during development
* Ensure security of data
* Write clear support documentation for new and existing users
* Generate interest in the open source developer community and encourage participation.

The project is managed by the excellent people at [North Country Public Radio](http://northcountrypublicradio.org) and supported by a digital humanities grant from the [National Endowment for Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/)
